# crystals-collector-game

This game was actually a lot of fun to make! The idea was pretty basic, but enough of a challenge to expand my understanding of solving problems with **JavaScript**.

The idea was to build a game where the user interact to accumulate points by clicking the crystals, with the goal of matching the target score. The target score was randomly generated each round, as were the point-values assigned to each crystal. The challenge to the user was that the point-value was not displayed directly- memory and mental math is key to winning.

*Aside from the problem solving excercise, building this app familiarized me more with jQuery and using the console as a basic way to test in the development stage.*
